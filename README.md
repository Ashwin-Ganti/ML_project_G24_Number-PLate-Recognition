Our project aims to recognize license number plates. 
This system assumes a frontal view of the vehicle and license plate, which is common in applications such as toll monitoring and parking lot validation, for instance. 
Our contribution is to detect the license plate in many different camera poses and allowing a rectification process before optimal character recognition.
